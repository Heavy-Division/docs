# Preparing the FMC

### Disclaimer
> Various airlines have different flows and orders for setting up the FMC. 
> This guide is not meant to cover all Airline SOPs, but to provide a generalized method 
> of setup applicable to the simulator.

> Some features may be missing. As we add more features we will update this guide.

## Settings 
Now that the aircraft has power, open the configuration menu by 
selecting `HEAVY` on the FMC main page, `CONFIGURATION` and open the `SIMBRIEF` menu. 

From this menu you will need to input: 
* Simbrief User ID 
* Simbrief Username 

in order to use the integrated flight plan request tool. 
Ensure that both are entered correctly. 

You can change your route import settings to import only the SID, STAR, neither, or both in the 
same menu. 

The `IMPORT STRATEGY` should be set to `SB` if you are not using the native MSFS flight planner from the world menu.

## IRS 
Select the `INIT REF` then `INDEX`, and head to the `POS` page.  Copy the IRS GPS Position by selecting the `GPS POS` field, and pasting by selecting the `SET IRS POST` field.

Alternatively, you can look up the charts for your current airport and parking gate, and enter the relevent info in the `REF AUROIRT`, `GATE`, and `SET HDG` fields.
## Route 
Setting up the route is fairly easy thanks to integrated simBrief flight planning. 
On the FMC main page select `RTE` then `ROUTE REQUEST` on the left. Select the `LOAD FROM SB` option 
if planning route from simBrief, otherwise select `LOAD FROM PFPX`. 

If you have trouble importing the route, please read our [support guide]() for troubleshooting route planning. 

**You must activate the route before using LNAV**. To do this, head back to the `RTE` page, 
select the `ACTIVATE` key on the bottom right, and confirm using the `EXEC` button once the green indicator lights up.

## Performance 
In the `INIT REF` menu then `INDEX`, then select the `PERF` option. Ensure that the ZFW and other fields match your flight plan.

> Thrust LIM is optional. For more in depth info visit our [advanced]() guide on selecting thrust limitations. We will skip this page for the purposes of this guide.

## Takeoff configuration 
Move onto the `TAKEOFF` page after `THRUST LIM`. Fill out the `FLAPS` field with a value of one of the following up to 20 degrees.

Then select each of the `V1`, `VR`, and `V2` speeds to automatically calculate. You will see a `FMC PREFLIGHT COMPLETE` message once you are finished.
