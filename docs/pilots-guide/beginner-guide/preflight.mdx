# Preflight 

We've added features you can access once the plane is turned on. It's recommended to configure these prior to beginning your flight. 

## Navdata 

The AIRAC cycle refers to the version of navigation data currently used by the aircraft. 
MSFS updates the cycle every Sim Update, and owners of a Navigraph subscription will have access to up-to-date nav data.
You may see a warning message on the Flight Management and Guidance Computer (FMGC)

`end date of database has passed select new cycle on ident page.`

This is warning exists to notify flight crew of outdated navdata, but can be safely ignored if you do not own a navigraph subscription.
If you do own a subscription and are seeing this message, continue reading below. 

## Flight Planning 

We recommend you do **not** use the MSFS Flight Planner (World Map) when planning routes. 
The Heavy Division B78XH adds [SimBrief](https://www.simbrief.com/home/){target=new} flight planning to the 787-10. 
If using flight planning tools like simBrief, you `NOT IN DATABASE`, `AWY/WPT Mismatch` OR the flight plan import may fail due to outdated/incorrect AIRAC cycle.
As we don't support outdated versions of the mod, check that you are using the most up-to-date version, as older versions have been known to lose simBrief compatibility.

In addition to SimBrief we've added [Professional Flight Planner X](http://www.flightsimsoft.com/pfpx/) (PFPX) support as an option for flight planning.

## Flight Plan Import 

To save time inputting your flight plan, we've incorporated a way to retrieve your simBrief flight plan and automatically enter it into the FMGC.

## Manual Flight Planning 

See the Route section [guide]() on manually inputting waypoints, departures, and SID/STAR procedures.

## Flight Plan Discontinuities 

Discontinuities such as (VECT) are normal and expected behaviors when importing flight plans. Read our page on [discontinuities]() to 
better understand how to manage them. 

## Payload management 

The aircraft supports manual cargo and fuel weight, but no native tools for passenger boarding/deboarding at this time. 
You may also change between metric and imperial units in the configuration settings menu.
