# 787-10 Encrypted Files 

## Overview 
Since the release of Microsoft FLight Simulator, Asobo has gradually increased access 
to files required to modify and enhance the default 787-10 Dreamliner. As of Sim Update 10,
it is now possible to make modifications to systems as well as the flight model. However, 
textures and the 3D model remain encrypted. 

We are pushing forward with development of the B789H, which will feature a in-house designed and modelled 
interior, exterior, textures, and animations. For developers interested in Blender related 3D work,
we recommend applying to work on the B789H project, where your skills will be of use. 

What's important to understand is that the B789H is not being built from nothing. 
We have already completed the basic underlying code necessary for the airliner with the 
B78XH. When writing software for the B78XH you are effectively writing software for the B789H,
since the former will eventually be ported to the later with adjustments.
